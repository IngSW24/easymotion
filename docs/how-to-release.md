## ðŸš€ Release Creation Procedure

### 1. Access the GitHub Repository

Access the GitHub repository of the project (API or WebApp).

### 2. Navigate to the Releases Section

- Click on **"Releases"** in the repository menu.
- Click on **"Draft a new release"**.

### 3. Tag Selection

Enter the tag name according to the conventions shown below:

| Tag Name Format      | Builds Triggered                                | Environment |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `vX.Y.Z`             | Build and push Docker images for API and WebApp | Production  |
| `vX.Y.Z-beta`        | Build and push Docker images for API and WebApp | Staging     |
| `api-vX.Y.Z`         | Build and push Docker image for API             | Production  |
| `api-vX.Y.Z-beta`    | Build and push Docker image for API             | Staging     |
| `webapp-vX.Y.Z`      | Build and push Docker image for WebApp          | Production  |
| `webapp-vX.Y.Z-beta` | Build and push Docker image for WebApp          | Staging     |

**Examples of valid tags:**

- `api-v1.2.3-beta`
- `webapp-v1.2.3-beta`
- `v1.2.3-beta`
- `api-v1.2.3`
- `webapp-v1.2.3`
- `v1.2.3`

### 4. Select the Reference Branch

- Choose the branch from which to release (`main` or other designated branch).
- Ensure the selected commit corresponds to the one intended for release.

### 5. Fill in the Changelog

In the **"Describe this release"** field, provide a clear and concise changelog including:

- Key new features.
- Any bug fixes.
- A note on breaking changes, if any.

**Example:**

```
## Release API v1.2.3

- Introduced OAuth2 authentication
- Fixed bug on /users endpoint
- Optimized queries to improve performance
```

> You can also autogenerate the changelog using the specific button on the release page

### 6. Publish the Release

Click **"Publish release"**.

---

## âœ… Post-Publication Automatic Actions

Once the release is published:

- The GitHub Actions pipeline is automatically triggered.
- Docker images are built and published based on the tag provided.
- `-beta` images are deployed to staging environments.
- Tags without `-beta` are used for production environments.
- Any build or push errors will trigger email notifications.

## ðŸ“š Additional Notes

- Follow semantic versioning: `X.Y.Z`
  - **X**: Major (breaking changes)
  - **Y**: Minor (backward-compatible features)
  - **Z**: Patch (bug fixes)
- `-beta` images must **not** be used in production environments.
