## What is Easymotion?

Easymotion is an open platform currently in development, dedicated to making healthcare for movement, physiotherapy, and nutrition more accessible and collaborative. This repository aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution that enables patients, physiotherapists, and healthcare professionals to connect, manage courses, and share resources efficiently.

- **Patients** can find and subscribe to courses, track their progress, and communicate with professionals.
- **Physiotherapists** can create and manage courses, monitor patient progress, and collaborate with other professionals.
- **Developers** can contribute to a modern, modular codebase built with best practices in mind.
